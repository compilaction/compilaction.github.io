                      **Compilaction**

So what is this blog about?
====================================================================================================
Are we turning the Hollywood industry into a SaaS provider for compile farms? Well not really ...

Me and my students have been playing around C++ and parallel programming for a while. We like
to torture parsers, freak out code generators and make those new shiny CPUs or GPUs heat up.
It occurred to me recently that the traditional academia[^academia] space-time continuum of journal and
conferences publication is ill-suited to properly disseminate some knowledge that revolves around
breaking through latest compiler technologies or new architectures.

So, in addition to our usual, flat and boring grayish LateX powered regular scientific
publications[^scholar], we will publish some smaller snippets of cool code, nice optimizations and the
occasional longer article about how and why we designed some of our libraries.

Speaking of libraries, we'll also promotes them around here by posting article about how they
work and solve problems and how they can be setup and used easily.

Meanwhile, smash that F5 button and compilaction!
